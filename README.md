#chrome-reload (reboot)

This is a simple fork of https://code.google.com/p/chrome-reload updated to work on modern chrome browsers.

The original project was designed using version 1 of the Chrome Extension manifest, and thus will not work in modern versions of Chrome.  This project's initial goal is to update the original's manifest format and remove the inline JavaScript which renders the project broken in modern versions of Chrome due to the new content security policy.
